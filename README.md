we have used Vite because it helps in managing the environment variables in frontend application so it provides an efficient and secure way to inject sensitive information into our javascript code during the build process which is otherwise not directly accessible in a browser environment.
Vite automatically supports modern Javascript syntax like ES modules, async/await,etc. 
By selecting Vanilla JavaScript in Vite we are opting for a clean, lightweight setup without any pre-configured frameworks or libraries like React/vue.
Technologies Used-
Vite: A modern, fast build tool and development server, used for bundling and optimizing the app.
Vanilla JavaScript: Plain JavaScript without any frameworks for a lightweight and flexible development experience.
OpenWeatherMap API: Used to fetch real-time weather data for cities worldwide.
HTML/CSS: For the structure and styling of the web page
