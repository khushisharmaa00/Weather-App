we have used Vite because it helps in managing the environment variables in frontend application so it provides an efficient and secure way to inject sensitive information into our javascript code during the build process which is otherwise not directly accessible in a browser environment.
Vite automatically supports modern Javascript syntax like ES modules, async/await,etc. 
By selecting Vanilla JavaScript in Vite we are opting for a clean, lightweight setup without any pre-configured frameworks or libraries like React/vue.
